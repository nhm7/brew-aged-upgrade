  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The CLI is installed as `brew-aged-upgrade`, not `aged-upgrade`.

      To enable daily auto-upgrade:
        brew-aged-upgrade start
    EOS
  end

  test do
    output = shell_output("#{bin}/brew-aged-upgrade help")
    assert_match "start", output
    assert_match "stop", output
    assert_match "status", output
  end
end
